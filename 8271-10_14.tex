\section*{Question Answering}

\begin{itemize}
\item [1] CRLite has 5 design goals. How is each goal achieved? Briefly describe them.

  Efficiency is acheived by minimizing the size of filter cascades with a bloom filter.
  Timelessness is acheived by by having more up to date revocations for the users.
  Privacy is acheived by not revealing any information about browser history.
  Deployability is acheived by backword compatibility with other systems.
  Auditability is acheived by use cryptographic logs that allow verification of the system by anyone that wants to check for errors.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Paper Critiques}

\subsection*{Short Summary}

The paper discusses a new system called CRLite for keeping TLS revocations up to date in browsers.
This alternative is meant to solve a number of different design issues that are lacking in other systems, as shown above.
This is important because out-of-date certificate information can be abused by attackers to harm users.
This is especially important because many browsers, and especially mobile and client applications, do not properly check for these revocations, making them vulnerable.
